# Example APIs

Four worked scenarios you can load, try and remove again - each a [collection](API.md#collections) of saved
queries plus a [role](API.md#permission-roles-templates) shaped like the key that would front it. They show what
QueryAPIGate is *for*: a named, small, rate-limited surface over a database, instead of a hand-rolled controller.

~~~bash
pip install queryapigate
queryapigate examples load          # installs everything below into the current folder (or --home DIR)
queryapigate serve                  # then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ui
queryapigate examples unload        # removes exactly what `load` installed - nothing else
~~~

The data is a small SQLite database generated on your machine (`examples.db`, about 2 MB: 60 films, 200 customers and
20,000 rentals over the last 120 days, dated relative to the day you load them so the "today" and "overdue" numbers
always have something to show). Nothing third-party is shipped. The connection is called `examples`.

## Loading, hiding and removing them

| | |
|---|---|
| `queryapigate examples load` | Install them. Idempotent: running it again changes nothing (no extra versions), and it finishes an interrupted load. |
| `queryapigate examples unload` | Remove exactly what was installed - the queries, roles, connection and database file. |
| `queryapigate examples status` | Say whether they are loaded (`Loaded`, `Partly loaded`, or `Not loaded`). |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_LOAD_EXAMPLES=yes` | Load them at server start - for a container (`docker run -e QUERYAPIGATE_LOAD_EXAMPLES=yes -v qag:/data ...`). Idempotent across restarts. Unset, or `no`, leaves things as they are: it never removes anything - use `unload`. |
| Admin UI | Saved Queries shows **Load example APIs** when the home is empty, and once loaded an "Example APIs are loaded" bar with **Remove examples**. |
| `POST` / `DELETE` / `GET /examples` | The same, over [HTTP](API.md#example-apis) (admin only). |

Everything installed is **marked `example`** (a top-level `"example": true` on each query file, and on the role and
connection entries), and removal deletes exactly what is marked:

- A query, role, connection or file of yours that merely shares a name is **never overwritten and never removed** -
  loading stops with a clear message and changes nothing until you rename it.
- If you edit the `examples` connection in the admin UI it stops being marked (it is yours now), so `unload` leaves
  it and a later `load` reports the conflict.
- **No API key is created.** A key would switch a server that has none from open to authenticated. The keys below
  are made from the example roles, by you, when you want them.
- If you granted a key one of the example collections, `unload` tells you, and that grant now reaches nothing (see
  `GET /collections`).

## 1. Reporting API - `examples-reporting`

A read-only, rate-limited key scoped to a few aggregate queries. Role `example-reporting`: no connections, the
`examples-reporting` collection, read-only, `200/hour`.

| Query | What it does | Parameters |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| `example_monthly_revenue` | Rentals and revenue per month | `months` 1-24, default 6 |
| `example_top_films` | Most-rented films, optionally in one category | `top_n` 1-50 (default 10), `category` (optional, one of six) |
| `example_revenue_by_category` | Revenue per category | `days` 1-120, default 30 |

~~~bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_monthly_revenue?months=3'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_top_films?top_n=5&category=Comedy'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_top_films?category=Nope'      # 400: category must be one of ...
~~~

Give a team its own key (with `QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY` set, using the admin key):

~~~bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api_keys -H 'X-API-Key: <admin key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name": "finance-team", "role": "example-reporting"}'          # the secret is shown once
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_monthly_revenue' -H 'X-API-Key: <the secret>'
~~~

That key can run these three queries and nothing else - no ad-hoc SQL, no other queries, and no other connection.

## 2. Dashboard data API - `examples-dashboard`

Small queries meant to be polled every few seconds. Each is cached for **30 seconds** (`cache_ttl`), so a wall of
dashboards polling costs one database query per half minute, not one per poll. Role `example-dashboard`, `600/minute`.

| Query | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `example_kpi_rentals_today` | Rentals and revenue so far today (UTC) |
| `example_kpi_active_rentals` | Rentals currently out |
| `example_kpi_overdue` | Out for more than 7 days |
| `example_recent_rentals` | A live feed (`hours` 1-168, default 24) |

~~~bash
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_kpi_active_rentals'    # X-Cache: MISS
curl -i 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_kpi_active_rentals'    # X-Cache: HIT, with an ETag
~~~

## 3. Data export API - `examples-export`

A ~20,000-row table meant for [streaming exports](API.md#streaming-exports): constant memory on the server however
large the result. Role `example-export`, `20/hour`.

~~~bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_all_rentals?stream=true&format=csv' -o rentals.csv
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_rentals_since?since=2026-09-01&stream=true&format=ndjson'   # incremental
~~~

Or write it to a file from cron with no server running, using the [CLI export](INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md#scheduled-exports-to-a-file):
`queryapigate export example_all_rentals --out '/exports/{name}_{date}.csv'`.

## 4. Partner / integration API - `examples-partner`

What you would hand an external company: a narrow, parameter-validated surface that cannot reach anything else.
Role `example-partner`: only the `examples-partner` collection, read-only, `60/minute`.

| Query | What it does | Rules |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `example_film_lookup` | One film and how it is doing | `film_id` required, integer >= 1 |
| `example_film_search` | Find films by part of a title | `text` required, 2-30 letters and spaces |

~~~bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api_keys -H 'X-API-Key: <admin key>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"name": "acme-corp", "role": "example-partner", "expires_at": "2026-12-31"}'   # expiry is per key
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_film_lookup?film_id=7'                 -H 'X-API-Key: <acme secret>'   # 200
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_top_films'                             -H 'X-API-Key: <acme secret>'   # 403
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_film_lookup?film_id=7&connection_name=other' -H 'X-API-Key: <acme secret>'   # 403
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/execute_sql -H 'X-API-Key: <acme secret>' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"sql": "SELECT * FROM rental", "connection_name": "examples"}'                                        # 403
~~~

Add a query to the `examples-partner` collection later and this key can run it with no change to the key - that is
what a [collection grant](API.md#granting-access-to-a-collection) is for. Export the whole set to Postman from the
admin UI's **Postman** button on the collection.

## Things to try next

- **Admin UI** (`/ui`): the Saved Queries tab groups these by collection; **Move…** shows which keys would gain or lose
  access before anything changes; the Audit Log records every change.
- **Docs and OpenAPI**: `/docs` lists exactly the queries the key you paste in can run - try it with the partner key.
- **Your own**: copy one of these queries into a new saved query pointed at your own connection - the SQL, parameter
  rules and `cache_ttl` carry over unchanged.
