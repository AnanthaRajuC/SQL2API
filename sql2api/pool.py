"""A small thread-safe pool of live database connections.

Only *idle* connections are pooled: a connection is checked out exclusively by one request, and on the way
back it is reset (its transaction ended) and kept for reuse - unless the request failed, in which case its
state is unknown and it is closed instead. The number of concurrent connections is not limited here; the
pool only bounds how many idle ones are kept around.
