"""One log line per event from the ``queryapigate`` logger, tagged with the request ID and the calling API key's
name that caused it (both ``-`` outside a request, e.g. at startup; key is also ``-`` when no key is
configured at all, and ``admin`` for ``QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY`` - see ``apikeys.Permission``). Plain text by
default; ``QUERYAPIGATE_JSON_LOGS=1`` switches to one JSON object per line for log aggregators.

In JSON mode, any caller-supplied ``extra={...}`` on a ``log.info()``/``log.warning()`` call becomes its
own top-level JSON key, not just text folded into ``message`` - see ``_JsonFormatter``. ``engine.py`` and
``app.py`` use this for fields a log aggregator would otherwise have to parse out of the message string
(``connection``, ``dialect``, ``status``, ``duration_ms``, ...), so a query or request can be filtered on
those directly rather than only by ``request_id``/``key``, which were already real fields before this.

``configure()`` is called from ``create_app()`` - the one place every entry point (``queryapigate serve``,
gunicorn/WSGI, the test suite) goes through - so logging is set up the same way regardless of how the app
is run, instead of relying on the CLI's ``logging.basicConfig()``, which never runs under a WSGI server.
