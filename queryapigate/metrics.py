"""In-process metrics, rendered as Prometheus text exposition format at ``/metrics``.

Counters and histograms live in this process's memory - correct for the image this project ships (gunicorn
with a single worker; see the Dockerfile, which explains why in a comment next to ``--workers 1``) but not
for a multi-process deployment, which would need a shared backing store instead (e.g. ``prometheus_client``
in its multiprocess mode) - nothing here does that.
