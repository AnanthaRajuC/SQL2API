# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-26

### Changed
- **License: from MIT to the Functional Source License, Version 1.1, MIT Future License (`FSL-1.1-MIT`).** QueryAPIGate
  is now *source-available* rather than open source. You can still use, modify and redistribute it for any purpose
  except a *Competing Use* - offering it to others in a commercial product or service that substitutes for it or
  offers substantially similar functionality (so: not selling it, or hosting it as a paid service). Running it inside
  your company, non-commercial education and research, and professional services for a licensee are all permitted.
  Each version becomes MIT on the second anniversary of its release. **Versions 0.4.0 through 0.6.1 were released under
  MIT; they are no longer distributed, and a copy already obtained under MIT stays under those terms.** The code is unchanged in this release; only the license and its metadata are
  (`LICENSE`, the package's `License-Expression`, the container image label, the README). Outside code contributions
  are not being accepted for now (CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Removed
- The Sakila and Chinook sample SQLite databases and the `examples/` folder that held them (with their two saved queries and
  the licence notices those datasets need). They were never part of the wheel; the repository now has no third-party
  data. Use `queryapigate examples load` for a working sample instead - its data is generated locally. The Docker demo's
  film titles (which came from Sakila) are replaced with generated ones, and the documentation's examples now use the
  generated `examples` connection (`film` table) instead of the `actor` table. The repository history was also reset to a single commit for this release, so earlier commits and releases are no longer published.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-25

A small fix; no behaviour change beyond it. Nothing to do when upgrading from 0.6.0.

### Fixed
- A key's `last_used_at` was not recorded for its first use when the host had booted less than 60 seconds earlier: the
  "never recorded" state was `0.0`, compared against `time.monotonic()` (which counts from boot on Linux), so the first
  use fell inside the throttle window and was skipped. Only a machine that had just booted was affected, which in
  practice meant freshly created CI runners - it made the CI test job fail on a random subset of Python versions on
  every run. Fixed by treating "never recorded" as absent, with a regression test on a simulated freshly-booted clock.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-25

**Upgrade recommended: this release fixes a security issue in scoped API keys** (see *Fixed*). Adds collections,
example APIs, a Postman export and caller-supplied request IDs. Stored keys, roles and saved queries from 0.5.0 work
unchanged. One behaviour change comes from the fix: a key granted a saved query (or collection) can no longer point it
at a different connection with `?connection_name=` unless it also holds a grant on that connection - a client that
relied on doing so needs that connection added to its key.

### Added
- **Collections** ([#35](BACKLOG.md)): a saved query can belong to one named collection, stored on the query
  file itself. A key or role can be granted a `collections` list - read-only, additive, live (it reaches whatever
  is in the collection now and later), with no `"*"` wildcard and no write access through it. Newly granted
  names must exist. New: `PUT /saved_sql/<name>/collection` (move; audited with the keys and roles that gain or
  lose access), `GET /collections` (queries, keys and roles per collection, including a grant whose collection
  has emptied), `PATCH /collections/<name>` (rename - resumable, never narrows access part-way; `merge` for an
  existing target), and `queryapigate collection export|import` (portable bundle of definitions only; validated
  like saving a query, all-or-nothing before writing, `--on-conflict fail|skip|new-version`, `--dry-run`).
  `collection` is also accepted by `PATCH /save_sql_to_file` and reported by `GET /list_files` and `GET /catalog`.
  The admin UI groups the Saved Queries list by collection, adds **Move…** with a who-gains/loses-access preview,
  rename, and a Collections field on the key and role forms.
- **Example APIs** ([#27](BACKLOG.md)): `queryapigate examples load | unload | status` installs four worked scenarios -
  reporting, dashboard (cached 30 s), streaming export and partner integration - as 11 saved queries in four
  collections, four matching roles, and an `examples` connection to a ~2 MB SQLite database generated locally (no
  third-party data shipped). Everything is marked `example` and removal deletes exactly that; loading refuses, changing
  nothing, if something of yours holds an example's name. Idempotent. `QUERYAPIGATE_LOAD_EXAMPLES=yes` loads them at
  startup (for containers; a problem is a warning, a malformed value is rejected). `GET/POST/DELETE /examples`, a Load
  / Remove control in the admin UI, and a walkthrough in `documentation/EXAMPLES.md`. No API key is created.
- **Postman export** of a collection: `GET /collections/<name>/postman`, `queryapigate collection export --format
  postman`, and a Postman button in the admin UI. One `GET /q/<name>` request per query with its parameters filled
  in from their own rules (a test runs every generated example back through the server's parameter validation);
  authentication is an empty `{{apiKey}}` variable, so the file never holds a key. Export only, and a snapshot.
- **New collection** in the admin UI: pick a name and the queries to file under it, with the who-gains/loses-access
  preview.
- **Caller-supplied `X-Request-Id`**: send your own (1-64 characters of letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `:`, `-` - a UUID
  works) and it is used in the response header, the log lines and a saved query's run history, so a run can be tied
  to a trace in your own system. Anything else is ignored and the server generates its own, as before; it is a
  correlation aid only and nothing authorises by it. Matched with `fullmatch`, so a trailing newline cannot smuggle
  a forged log line in.
- A test that every route appears in the OpenAPI document.

### Fixed
- Admin UI: at widths between about 1240 and 1320 px the last tab (Run SQL) was clipped now that tabs carry counts - the
  compact two-row header now starts below 1360 px. Collection group headers in the Saved Queries list no longer truncate
  a collection's name behind their own controls.
- `X-Request-Id` was not in the CORS exposed headers, so a browser page on another origin could not read the ID
  the server returned; it is now exposed (and allowed on requests).
- **A key granted a saved query (`queries`) could run that query's SQL against any connection** by adding
  `?connection_name=<other>` (or `connection_name` in a POST body), even with `connections: []`. A `queries` or
  `collections` grant now authorises the query only on its own connection; another one needs a real connection
  grant. Anyone relying on scoped external keys should upgrade.

### Changed
- One function (`apikeys.can_run_saved()`) now decides whether a caller can reach a saved query for `/openapi.json`
  and `/catalog` (previously the same rule was written out separately in each), saved-query validation is
  shared by saving and importing, and a query's effective parameters are derived in one place for OpenAPI, the
  catalogue and the Postman export.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- **Breaking: renamed from SQL2API to QueryAPIGate.** A clean break with no compatibility aliases, so an
  existing deployment must change these before upgrading (full table and rationale in
  [Upgrading from SQL2API](documentation/INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md#upgrading-from-sql2api)):
  the PyPI package is `queryapigate` (was `sql2api`), the command is `queryapigate` (was `sql2api`), the Python
  package is `queryapigate`, environment variables are `QUERYAPIGATE_*` (were `SQL2API_*`), Prometheus metrics
  are `queryapigate_*` (were `sql2api_*`), the Docker image is `ghcr.io/anantharajuc/queryapigate`, and the
  JSON log `logger` field and the admin UI's browser-storage keys use the new name. Data files
  (`db_connections.json`, `saved_sql/`, `api_keys.json`, ...) are unchanged. Because an unset API key means an
  open server, the old `SQL2API_*` variables are not merely ignored: a server that still finds any of them in
  its environment refuses to start and names each one to rename, rather than silently running unprotected.
  To migrate environment files in place: `sed -i 's/SQL2API_/QUERYAPIGATE_/g' <file>`; the same substitution
  with `sql2api_` -> `queryapigate_` fixes Prometheus queries and alert rules. Releases 0.1.0 through 0.4.0
  below shipped as `sql2api` and are described under that name.
  This is the first release published under the new name.

### Added
- `queryapigate export <query> --out <path>` (closing #31): runs a saved query and writes its full result to a
  file, entirely in-process against `QUERYAPIGATE_HOME` - no server needs to be running, no HTTP round trip, no
  API key. Built for cron/systemd/Kubernetes CronJob to call, deliberately not a scheduler itself.
  `{name}`/`{date}` placeholders in `--out`; `--format csv|tsv|ndjson` (the same formats `?stream=true`
  supports, via the same underlying code path - `formats.iter_stream_chunks()`, newly factored out of
  `stream_response()` so both share it); `--connection` overrides the saved query's own default;
  `--param name=value` (repeatable) supplies a required parameter. Writes to a temp file and renames into
  place only on success, so a failed run never leaves a partial file at the final path; exits non-zero on
  any failure so cron's own failure handling works unmodified. See [Scheduled exports to a
  file](documentation/INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md#scheduled-exports-to-a-file).
- Configurable, exportable audit log retention (closing #30): `QUERYAPIGATE_AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT` replaces the
  hardcoded 500-entry cap on `audit_log.json` (validated at startup, following the same pattern
  `QUERYAPIGATE_STREAM_MAX_ROWS` already uses - always a positive count, never "unbounded", since the file is
  read and rewritten in full on every audit event). `QUERYAPIGATE_AUDIT_LOG_EXPORT_FILE`, when set, also appends
  every entry to a separate, never-capped, never-rewritten file (one JSON object per line) - for retention a
  rolling cap can never satisfy, independent of the primary write so a problem with one never blocks the
  other. See [Audit log](documentation/API.md#audit-log).
- Package metadata for PyPI discoverability (closing #28): `Documentation` and `Repository` links in
  `[project.urls]` (PyPI's sidebar renders both as clickable links; only `Homepage`/`Issues`/`Changelog`
  were set before), and `Environment :: Web Environment`, `Operating System :: OS Independent` and
  per-version `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9` .. `3.14` classifiers matching the CI test matrix
  exactly (PyPI's "Programming Language" filter facet uses these). Deliberately does *not* add a
  `Typing :: Typed` classifier or a `py.typed` marker - the codebase is gradually typed for `mypy`'s own
  benefit (see `[tool.mypy]`'s comment), not annotated throughout, and that classifier is a PEP 561 promise
  to consumers this project doesn't actually keep yet. Verified with `python -m build` and
  `twine check dist/*`, and by inspecting the built wheel's own `METADATA` file.
- Modernized `license` in `pyproject.toml` to a PEP 639 SPDX expression (`license = "MIT"`, replacing
  `license = { text = "MIT" }`) and dropped the now-redundant `License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License`
  classifier - `python -m build` was warning that the classifier form is deprecated. The build now emits
  `License-Expression: MIT` and bundles `LICENSE` under the wheel's standard `licenses/` directory
  automatically, with no change to what's actually licensed.
- Live usage on the Connections and API Keys admin-UI screens (closing #32): `GET /connections` and
  `GET /api_keys` now carry a `usage` object per entry (queries run, failures, rows returned - plus average
  latency for a connection) aggregated from the same in-process counters `/metrics` already renders, via two
  new `metrics.summary_for_key()`/`metrics.summary_for_connection()` functions. Previously that data existed
  only in Prometheus text form; a key or connection's row showed grants and, at best, a single
  `last_used_at` timestamp, with no way to see how much it had actually been used or how often it had
  failed without a separate `/metrics` scrape. See [Connections](documentation/API.md#connections) and
  [Authentication and permissions](documentation/API.md#authentication-and-permissions).
- A saved query's History tab (closing #33) now shows `request_id` and `key_name` columns (`execution_history`
  already recorded both, added for the log-correlation work closing #19, but the admin UI never rendered
  either), plus a client-side status filter (all/success/failed) and a search box over connection, caller,
  request ID and error text. See [Admin UI](documentation/API.md#admin-ui).
- The Audit Log tab (closing #34) now has an action-type filter and a search box (actor, target, timestamp),
  filtering client-side over what it already fetched, and a create/delete snapshot's `changes` omits unset
  fields (`null`/`""`/`[]`) instead of always listing every field on the entity - a diff (an update) is
  unaffected, since it never had unset fields to begin with. See [Audit log](documentation/API.md#audit-log).
- `GET /catalog` (closing #26): every saved query a caller can reach, and the terms it's offered under -
  `cache_ttl`, whether that specific caller can write through it (per-query write curation may differ query
  to query), and the caller's own rate limit alongside the server-wide one. Assembled from data that already
  existed but was scattered across admin-only screens a scoped key can never reach; scoped by the same
  reachability rule `/openapi.json` already uses, so a query a caller can't use is never listed. New
  `config.format_rate_limit()` (the inverse of `parse_rate_limit()`) renders a resolved `(count, seconds)`
  limit back into its human form, e.g. `"100/minute"`. See [The API catalogue](documentation/API.md#the-api-catalogue).
- A **Metrics** tab in the admin UI (closing #29) and a pre-built Grafana dashboard
  (`documentation/grafana-dashboard.json`). The tab parses `/metrics` client-side into stat tiles (requests,
  error rate, active queries, pool idle connections, rate-limit rejections, rows returned), two bar charts
  (requests by status, queries by connection) and a per-connection latency/error table - a live snapshot,
  deliberately with no history or trends, so a deployment with no Prometheus/Grafana stack still gets some
  visibility; needs no API key, since `/metrics` is already public. The dashboard is for deployments that do
  have that stack: request/query rate and latency (p50/p95/p99), error rate, rows returned, active queries,
  pool occupancy and rate-limit rejections, ready to import against a Prometheus scrape of `/metrics`. See
  [Seeing it: a built-in view, or a real dashboard](documentation/API.md#seeing-it-a-built-in-view-or-a-real-dashboard).
- Refreshed admin UI screenshots in the README (Connections, Saved Queries, API Keys, Roles, Run SQL), plus new
  ones for a saved query's History tab, the Audit Log and the Metrics tab.

### Fixed
- The admin UI header broke at common laptop widths once it reached eight tabs: tab labels wrapped onto two
  lines at 1280px, the API key bar's Apply button was clipped at the right edge, and between roughly 980px and
  1200px the header overflowed and scrolled the whole page sideways. Labels no longer wrap, the key bar never
  shrinks, the tab row scrolls horizontally if it ever runs out of room, and below 1240px the tabs move onto
  their own row. Checked with no horizontal page scroll at every width from 390px to 1440px.
- The action and status dropdowns on the Audit Log and saved-query History filters stretched to the full row
  width, pushing the search box onto its own line; they now size to their content.
- The Connections, API Keys, Roles and Audit Log tables now scroll horizontally inside their panel on narrow
  screens instead of widening the whole page.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- Named permission roles (closing #22): a role (`/roles`, admin only) is a reusable *template* for a key's
  `connections`, `allow_writes`, `queries`, `rate_limit`, `allowed_ips` and `allowed_write_ops` -
  `POST /api_keys` with `"role": "<name>"` copies those fields onto the new key once, at creation. It's a
  template, not a live link: editing or deleting a role afterward never touches a key already created from
  it, since `authenticate()` only ever reads the key's own stored entry. A key records which role it came
  from in `created_from_role`, purely informational. `role` can't be combined with an explicit grant field in
  the same request (`400`) - `expires_at` is the one exception, since it's inherently per-key rather than
  part of a shared template. Admin UI gained a Roles tab and a "Create from" picker in the New API key form.
  See [Permission roles](documentation/API.md#permission-roles-templates).
- Encryption at rest for connection passwords (`SQL2API_SECRET_KEY`, closing out #24): a literal password is
  now encrypted with Fernet before it touches disk - existing connections immediately at startup, new ones
  the moment they're saved - and decrypted only in memory at the instant a connection is actually opened.
  Needs the new optional `sql2api[encryption]` extra (bundled in `[all]`); a clear startup error names the
  missing package or a malformed key rather than a raw `ImportError` or silent failure. A `${VAR}` reference
  is untouched either way - never a secret stored in the file to begin with. An encrypted password masks the
  same as a literal one in `GET /connections` and the audit log; a missing or rotated
  `SQL2API_SECRET_KEY` fails a request clearly (`500`, naming the problem) rather than passing ciphertext to
  the driver, and a startup warning fires if encrypted passwords exist on disk with no key configured to
  read them. See [Encryption at rest](documentation/API.md#encryption-at-rest-for-connection-passwords).
- Per-query write curation for API keys: a `queries` entry can now be `{"name": ..., "allow_writes": true}`
  instead of a plain name, granting write access to that one saved query specifically - on top of, never
  instead of, the key's blanket `allow_writes`. Lets a key have `connections: []` and `allow_writes: false`
  yet still write through one curated endpoint (e.g. `submit_order`), the shape the external-client
  `queries` grant was originally built for but couldn't quite express. The `"*"` wildcard can never carry a
  write grant - wanting write access to a specific query means enumerating the whole `queries` list
  explicitly, the same explicit opt-in shape `allow_writes` already has everywhere else. Admin UI's
  saved-query checkbox grid gained a "write" checkbox per query. See
  [Per-query write curation](documentation/API.md#per-query-write-curation).
- Finer-grained query governance, two of three gaps: an API key with write access can now be narrowed to
  specific `allowed_write_ops` (e.g. `["insert", "update"]`) rather than every write keyword being equally
  permitted once `allow_writes` is on - checked in `sqltools.validate_sql()`, never restricts a read-only
  statement. A new `SQL2API_STREAM_MAX_ROWS` caps a `?stream=true` export, which was previously unbounded
  regardless of `SQL2API_MAX_PAGE_SIZE`; past the cap the export ends early, a `WARNING` is logged, and
  `sql2api_stream_exports_total` counts it under a new `status="truncated"`, distinct from `"success"`.
  Admin UI's API Keys tab gained an "Allowed write operations" form field and shows a write-op count on the
  Access column. Table-level allow-listing (the third, hardest gap) remains open - it needs real SQL
  parsing, not the lightweight guard this project deliberately uses. See
  [Write operation granularity](documentation/API.md#write-operation-granularity) and
  [Streaming exports](documentation/API.md#streaming-exports).
- Structured per-query observability fields, second slice (SQL hash, serialization time): the per-query and
  streaming-start log lines now carry a full SHA-256 `sql_hash` alongside the existing full SQL text, so a
  log aggregator can spot "did this same query run elsewhere/before" without storing or searching the SQL
  itself. Response body serialization (JSON/CSV/TSV/XML/YAML/XLSX encoding) is now timed separately from
  query execution - a new `sql2api_serialization_duration_seconds` metric by output format, a
  `serialization_ms` field on the per-request access log line, and a `serialization_ms` field on a saved
  query's `execution_history` entries alongside the existing `duration_ms` (query time) - so encoding cost
  (which can rival query time for XLSX or other large-page exports) is no longer invisible, folded into
  "whatever's left over" between total and query latency. Closes out #19 entirely. See
  [Observability](documentation/API.md#observability).
- Structured per-query observability fields, first slice (query correlation): a saved query's
  `execution_history` entries now carry `request_id` and `key_name`, so a slow or failed run visible in the
  admin UI's History tab can be traced back to the exact log line and caller that produced it. In
  `SQL2API_JSON_LOGS` mode, the per-query, streaming-start, slow-query and per-request access log lines now
  also carry their key fields (`connection`, `dialect`, `limit`/`offset`/`timeout`, `duration_ms`,
  `method`/`path`/`status`) as real top-level JSON keys via `extra={...}`, not just folded into `message` -
  a log aggregator can filter or aggregate on them directly. See
  [Observability](documentation/API.md#observability).
- Basic data visualization in the admin UI: a "Chart" toggle on any tabular result (Run SQL and saved-query
  Run tabs) draws a quick bar chart of the current page, off by default. Deliberately scoped to the page on
  screen, not the full result - a visible note says so, since `page_size` is capped and a chart of one page
  of a much larger result could otherwise look complete without being one. Label/value columns are
  pickable; no charting library, inline SVG matching the editor's own no-dependency approach.
- Audit logging for administrative actions (`GET /audit_log`, admin only): a durable, capped record of
  every API key, connection and saved query created, changed or removed, distinct from live request/query
  observability. An update records a diff of only the fields that actually changed; a create or delete
  records a full snapshot instead. A connection's password is never a value in either form - masked as
  `********` in a snapshot, reported only as the literal string `"changed"` in a diff - and an API key's
  entry never includes its secret or hash. Admin UI gained an "Audit Log" tab. See
  [Audit log](documentation/API.md#audit-log).
- A startup warning for connections storing a literal, non-empty password directly in
  `db_connections.json` instead of a `${VAR}` reference to an environment variable - names every affected
  connection in one line. Doesn't block startup or change stored data; a nudge toward the existing `${VAR}`
  convention, not new enforcement. See [Connections](documentation/API.md#connections).
- Two new `/metrics` series: `sql2api_rows_returned_total` (rows actually returned, by connection, dialect
  and calling key - the trimmed page for a paged query, or however many rows made it out of a streaming
  export before it finished or failed partway through) and `sql2api_active_queries` (a gauge of queries
  currently executing, paged or mid-stream - for a streaming export this stays incremented for as long as
  the client keeps reading, since the connection stays checked out the whole time, not just for the initial
  dispatch). See [Observability](documentation/API.md#observability).
- IP allowlisting per API key (`allowed_ips`, a list of IP addresses or CIDR ranges - IPv4 or IPv6, mixed
  freely): real defense in depth for a key handed to an external party with known, stable infrastructure,
  since even a leaked key then only authenticates from an expected address. Checked in
  `apikeys.authenticate()` against the same client address `SQL2API_TRUST_PROXY`/`ProxyFix` already
  establish as trustworthy for rate limiting, not re-derived. Uses the stdlib `ipaddress` module for parsing
  and containment - no new dependency. A request from outside the list fails exactly like a wrong key
  (`401`), not a distinct error. Restricts *who* may use a key at all, independent of per-key rate limiting
  (how much a caller who is already allowed may do); the admin key is never restricted by it. `PATCH
  /api_keys/<name>` with an explicit `{"allowed_ips": null}` clears an existing restriction, the same
  pattern `expires_at`/`rate_limit` use. Admin UI gained an "Allowed IPs" form field and an "IPs" table
  column. See [IP allowlisting](documentation/API.md#ip-allowlisting).
- Per-key rate limiting (`rate_limit`, e.g. `"100/minute"`): an API key can now carry its own quota,
  checked *in addition to* `SQL2API_RATE_LIMIT`, never instead of it - so handing scoped keys to several
  external clients no longer means they all draw from one shared server-wide budget where a single noisy
  integration can exhaust it for everyone else. Applies even when the server-wide limit is unset entirely.
  Rejections from a key's own limit read `{"error": "Rate limit exceeded for this API key", ...}`,
  distinguishable from the server-wide rejection's plain `"Rate limit exceeded"`, and surface their own
  `X-RateLimit-Key-Limit`/`X-RateLimit-Key-Remaining` headers alongside the existing server-wide pair.
  `PATCH /api_keys/<name>` with an explicit `{"rate_limit": null}` clears an existing per-key limit.
  Required a small architectural addition, not just a new field: `RateLimiter` only ever enforces one
  `(count, period)` spec per instance (by design - it wipes every bucket when a *different* spec arrives, so
  an admin changing `SQL2API_RATE_LIMIT` doesn't mix old and new rules), so two keys with different limits
  need genuinely separate limiter instances - see the new `ratelimit.KeyRateLimiters`, one instance per
  distinct spec actually in use, with keys sharing a spec correctly sharing an instance too. Admin UI gained
  a "Rate limit" field and table column. See
  [Per-key rate limiting](documentation/API.md#per-key-rate-limiting).
- Per-key usage visibility (`last_used_at`): `GET /api_keys` now reports when a key last authenticated a
  request, so a stale key nobody has called in months is easy to spot, or a newly-issued external key's
  wiring can be confirmed. Updated at most once a minute per key (not on every single request, which for a
  busy key would turn every call into a disk write for no real benefit) - read it as "roughly how
  recently," not an exact timestamp. A never-used key simply has no `last_used_at` field. The admin UI's
  API Keys table gained a "Last used" column alongside "Created". See
  [Last used](documentation/API.md#last-used).
- API key expiry (`expires_at`, `YYYY-MM-DD`): a key stops authenticating on its own once the date passes
  (valid through the end of that date), checked live on every request the same way `active` already is - no
  background sweep, nothing to schedule or fail silently. For time-boxed access (a trial integration, a
  partner engagement with a known end date) without anyone having to remember to come back and revoke it.
  `PATCH /api_keys/<name>` with an explicit `{"expires_at": null}` clears an existing expiry without
  rotating the secret; omitting the field from a `PATCH` body leaves whatever expiry a key already had
  untouched. The admin UI's API Keys form gained an "Expires" date field, and the table shows each key's
  expiry (or "never"), visually distinguishing an already-expired key from an active one. See
  [Key expiry](documentation/API.md#key-expiry).
- A "Curl" tab on each saved query in the admin UI, after Run/SQL/History: a ready-to-copy `curl` command
  for that query's `GET /q/<name>` endpoint, with each parameter that has no declared default shown as a
  readable `<name>` placeholder to fill in (not percent-encoded - built as a plain string rather than through
  `URL.href`, which would otherwise turn `<id>` into `%3Cid%3E`) and the API key, if any, redacted to a
  placeholder rather than the session's real value, same policy as the Run SQL tab's own "Copy as curl".
- Per-saved-query API key access (`queries`): a key can now be scoped to a specific list of saved-query
  names, independent of and additive with `connections` - so an external-client key can reach exactly
  `monthly_revenue` and a handful of other approved queries, with no connection access of its own and no
  ad-hoc SQL access, while internal keys keep the existing coarser connection-wide grant unchanged.
  `queries` may also be `"*"` for every saved query by name without ad-hoc access, a middle tier between a
  single connection and full admin. `/openapi.json`/`/docs` now reflect a key's actual reach - a
  `queries`-scoped key sees only its own approved catalogue, not the full internal list of saved queries,
  closing a pre-existing gap where any authenticated key could see every saved query's name, description
  and parameters regardless of its own connection scope. Backward compatible: a key created before this
  field existed keeps behaving exactly as it did. See
  [Per-saved-query access](documentation/API.md#per-saved-query-access-external-clients).
- Streaming exports: `?stream=true` on `POST /execute_sql` and `GET`/`POST /q/<name>` (csv/tsv/ndjson only)
  streams the whole result straight from the database cursor instead of capping it at `page_size` - always
  read-only regardless of `SQL2API_ALLOW_WRITES`, since a large export has no business mutating data (this
  also sidesteps a lot of incidental complexity around commit timing on a connection held open for a long
  download). MySQL (an unbuffered cursor), PostgreSQL (a named, server-side cursor) and ClickHouse
  (`execute_iter`) stream without the driver buffering the whole result client-side first - verified
  end-to-end against real servers: 1 million rows streamed over real HTTP with the server process's own
  memory sampled throughout stayed flat (~49-55MB for MySQL/PostgreSQL), against several hundred MB fetching
  the same result the ordinary way. SQLite, H2, the generic `jdbc` type and DuckDB still bound this
  project's own memory to one batch at a time regardless of result size, even where the underlying engine or
  driver holds more than that internally (documented per-dialect, not assumed - see the `_DuckDB`/`_H2`/
  `_Postgres` driver docstrings in `runners.py`). A PostgreSQL-specific quirk only a real server surfaced:
  a named cursor's `execute()` is really a `DECLARE CURSOR` under the hood and does not run the query at all
  - column info and `statement_timeout` cancellation are only available after the *first fetch*, the reverse
  of every other driver here. See [Streaming exports](documentation/API.md#streaming-exports).
- Generic DuckDB connections (`db: "duckdb"`) - opt-in via `sql2api[duckdb]`, needing no external runtime
  (a native Python extension, like SQLite). One connection type covers two uses: a genuinely capable
  embedded database (`database: <path>`, same shape as SQLite) and querying CSV/JSON/Parquet files directly
  from a saved query's own SQL (`SELECT * FROM read_csv(:path)`), no import step or new connection fields.
  Schema introspection, pooling and the SQL guard's ANSI (quote-doubling) literal rules all apply unchanged.
  Two things a real DuckDB database surfaced that aren't in its docs: opening a second connection to a file
  with a different read-only setting than one already open on it in-process fails outright, so - like
  `h2`/`jdbc` - every pooled connection here is opened read-write and the read-only guarantee rests on the
  SQL guard alone; and unlike `h2`/`jdbc`, the query time limit *is* enforced, via `Connection.interrupt()`
  on a background timer, since DuckDB's Python client (unlike JDBC through jaydebeapi) exposes a real
  cancellation hook. See [DuckDB connections](documentation/DATABASE_CONNECTION_CONFIGURATION.md#duckdb-connections).
- A show/hide toggle on the connection form's password field, in both create and edit mode - verified with
  a real headless-Chrome test that it doesn't disturb the existing password-mask round-trip.
- The Run SQL tab's stat bar now leads with the response's HTTP status code and status text
  (Postman-style "200 OK · 1 row · json · 8 ms"), accent-colored to read as success at a glance; the error
  path is unchanged. Verified with a real headless-Chrome test.
- The admin UI's Run SQL tab and New saved query drawer have a Schema panel next to the SQL editor: lists
  the selected connection's tables, expands to show columns (type/nullability as a tooltip), and clicking a
  table or column inserts its name at the cursor. Updates automatically when the connection changes; a
  connection whose schema isn't available shows that message inline rather than through the page's error
  banner. A thin client of the existing `GET /connections/<name>/schema` endpoint - no new backend logic.
  Verified end-to-end with a real headless Chrome (Playwright) test covering both mount points, expand/
  collapse, click-to-insert for both tables and columns, connection-switch reactivity, the unsupported-
  dialect message, and the refresh button - zero uncaught JS errors.
- `mypy` runs in CI (gradual typing - `[tool.mypy]` in `pyproject.toml`; the codebase has no type hints yet,
  so it catches genuine static errors rather than demanding annotations everywhere). It found two real, if
  low-impact, issues fixed here: `runners._Driver.DIALECT` was untyped, so mypy inferred `None` as its exact
  type and flagged every dialect subclass for assigning a string to it; and `metrics.py`'s module-level
  counters had no annotation for their (tuple key -> value) shape. mypy 2.x dropped support for running on
  Python 3.9 (`Requires-Python >=3.10`), so CI's 3.9 job resolves the last compatible 1.x release instead -
  which, it turned out, disagrees with 2.x about whether `ignore_missing_imports` alone covers a module
  that's installed but ships no type stubs (PyYAML's `import-untyped` error, as opposed to one mypy can't
  find at all). `disable_error_code = ["import-untyped"]` covers it on both mypy generations.
- Test coverage is measured in CI and uploaded to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AnanthaRajuC/SQL2API) (a
  badge is in the README) - currently 93% across `sql2api/` from the unit test suite alone (not counting the
  real-database integration tests).
- Python 3.14 added to the CI test matrix.
- Generic JDBC connections (`db: "jdbc"`) reach any database not covered by a dedicated driver - Oracle,
  SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake and others - by generalising the embedded-JVM approach `h2` already used.
  A connection needs `jar` (the vendor's driver jar), `driver_class` and `jdbc_url` instead of
  `host`/`port`/`database`; everything else (the SQL guard, parameter binding, pooling, output formats)
  is unchanged. Two limits are inherent to sharing one JVM per process, not specific to this connection
  type, and are documented in [DATABASE_CONNECTION_CONFIGURATION.md](documentation/DATABASE_CONNECTION_CONFIGURATION.md#generic-jdbc-connections):
  `SQL2API_QUERY_TIMEOUT` is not enforced (no portable way to cancel a statement across arbitrary JDBC
  drivers), and a *new* `jdbc` connection whose jar was not already on the classpath when the JVM first
  started needs the server restarted before it can be used. Schema introspection
  (`GET /connections/<name>/schema`) answers 400 for this connection type rather than guessing at a
  vendor's system catalogue. Verified end-to-end against a real H2 server reached through the *generic*
  driver (not the dedicated `h2` one) - connection pooling, bound parameters, client-side pagination
  (LIMIT/OFFSET is not portable SQL either, so it is no longer appended server-side for this type), the
  read-only guard, and the schema-browser boundary - plus the JVM classpath-union logic that lets an H2
  and a jdbc connection share the one JVM regardless of which one is used first.
- The admin UI (`/ui`) has an API Keys tab: create, edit and revoke scoped API keys, matching the
  connections/saved-query tabs' style. A freshly created key's secret is shown once, with a copy button,
  the same one-time reveal the API itself enforces. A scoped (non-admin) key sees the same "only the admin
  key" message here as on the Connections and Saved Queries tabs. Verified end-to-end with a real headless
  Chrome browser: create, the secret-reveal, edit (including switching between the `"*"` wildcard and
  specific connections), revoke, and the admin-only empty state for a scoped key - zero uncaught JS errors
  across the whole flow.
- Audit logging: log lines and `/metrics` now carry the name of the API key that made the request - `admin`
  for `SQL2API_API_KEY`, a scoped key's own name, or `-` when no key is configured at all. Distinguishing
  `admin` from `-` needed splitting what was one "no key configured" state into two in `apikeys.Permission`.
  Kept off the latency histograms so the number of keys never multiplies their bucketed output; requests and
  query counts still carry it.
- Opt-in response caching for saved queries: set `cache_ttl` (seconds) when saving one. A cache hit answers
  with the identical body and `X-Cache: HIT` (`X-Cache: MISS` on a fresh response), carries `ETag` and
  `Cache-Control: max-age=<cache_ttl>`, and honours `If-None-Match` with a bodyless `304`. Never used for a
  saved query whose SQL is a write, regardless of `cache_ttl` - serving a cached response in its place
  would silently skip that write - and a cache hit is not recorded in `execution_history`, since nothing
  ran against the database. Verified against a real MySQL server, including that a cached write still runs
  on every call.
- A documentation site (MkDocs, Material theme), built from this README and `documentation/` - there is
  still exactly one place to edit each document; `docs/` only mirrors their paths so cross-links keep
  working. Deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/docs.yml` on every push to `main` that touches a
  doc file (needs a one-time `Settings -> Pages -> Source: GitHub Actions` from a repository admin).
- Per-key API permissions: `SQL2API_API_KEY` stays a full-access admin key, unchanged. New scoped keys
  (`POST /api_keys`, admin only) are each limited to a list of connection names (or every connection) and
  can be denied write access even when the server otherwise allows it - a key's `allow_writes` can only
  narrow `SQL2API_ALLOW_WRITES`, never widen it. Only the admin key can manage connections, saved queries
  or other API keys. A key's secret is never stored, only its SHA-256 hash in `api_keys.json`; the server
  generates it and shows it exactly once, when the key is created. Creating the first scoped key turns on
  authentication for the whole server immediately, even without `SQL2API_API_KEY` set (the server warns at
  startup if that would lock configuration changes out, since only the admin key can manage the server).
- Observability: every response carries `X-Request-Id`, and log lines written while handling that request
  carry the same ID (plain text by default; `SQL2API_JSON_LOGS=1` for one JSON object per line). A query
  taking at least `SQL2API_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD` seconds (default 1) is logged as a warning. `GET /metrics`
  (always public, like `/health`) serves Prometheus text-format metrics: request and query counts/latency
  histograms (by endpoint/status and by connection/dialect), idle pool occupancy, and rate-limit rejections.
  Logging is now configured once inside `create_app()`, so it applies under gunicorn/WSGI too, not just
  `sql2api serve` - previously `INFO`-level application logs were silently dropped in that path.
- `GET /connections/<name>/schema` lists a connection's tables and views with their columns (name, type,
  nullability, position) - self-service query writing without leaving the API. One catalogue query per
  database (`information_schema` for MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2, `system.tables`/`system.columns` for ClickHouse,
  `sqlite_master`/`pragma_table_info` for SQLite), run through the normal read-only execution pipeline, so
  it needs no new driver logic. Capped at 5000 columns per connection (`truncated: true` if a schema is
  larger than that).
- A small admin UI at `/ui`: manage connections (including proper password-mask round-tripping) and saved
  queries (create, run, per-version delete, an execution-history view per version), and run ad-hoc SQL with
  a syntax-highlighted editor, page-size presets and Next/Previous paging - without leaving the browser.
  Self-contained (no build step, no external script or stylesheet) and a pure client of the existing JSON
  API - no new server-side logic. Linked from `/docs`, and shares its `X-API-Key` storage with the docs
  page. Query results are always rendered through DOM APIs, never `innerHTML`, so a value coming back from
  a database can never execute as markup - verified with a 39-assertion real-browser (Playwright) test,
  including an XSS-payload check, run both unauthenticated and with an API key set.
- A documentation callout pointing out that `/openapi.json` can be imported directly by URL into Postman or
  Insomnia to get a ready-made request collection - no separate export step.
- An "Explain" button next to Run on the Run SQL tab: runs `EXPLAIN <current query>` through the existing
  execute path and shows the plan, a UI shortcut for a statement the SQL guard already allows.
- A collapsible "Headers" panel under query results, listing every header the response actually carries
  (`X-Page`, `X-Request-Id`, etc.), built from data `renderResponse()` already has.
- "Copy as curl" and "Copy as TSV" buttons on the Run SQL tab's results: the former builds the exact `curl`
  command for the request just made (with the API key, if any, redacted to a `YOUR_KEY_HERE` placeholder so
  copying the command doesn't leak the key), the latter copies the current result rows as a paste-ready TSV
  table for Excel/Sheets - both pure client-side transforms of data already on hand.
- A `sessionStorage`-backed ad-hoc query history on the Run SQL tab: the last 20 distinct queries run,
  clickable to restore into the editor, surviving a page reload within the same tab.
- A "preview" affordance next to each table in the schema browser (both the Run SQL tab's panel and the New
  saved query drawer's) that fills in and runs `SELECT * FROM <table>` through the existing execute path, so
  a table's data can be seen without hand-writing SQL.
- A collapsible JSON tree for non-tabular `/execute_sql` responses (anything that isn't a JSON array),
  replacing the previous flat `<pre>` dump - each object/array level can be expanded or collapsed.

  All eight of the above were verified end-to-end with real headless-Chrome (Playwright) tests against a
  live server, including a dedicated clipboard-reading test for "Copy as curl"/"Copy as TSV" and coverage of
  both schema-browser preview entry points - zero uncaught JS errors across the runs.

### Fixed
- `GET /list_files` returned 404 ("Folder not found") on a brand-new install before anything had ever been
  saved, instead of an empty list - inconsistent with the very similar `latest_versions()` used for the
  OpenAPI catalogue, which already handled this correctly. A list endpoint with nothing to list now
  answers `{"files": []}` with 200, as it always should have.
- **Security hardening (MySQL/ClickHouse):** the single-statement/read-only SQL guard now reads string
  literals with the quoting rules the *target database* actually uses. MySQL and ClickHouse honour a
  backslash escape inside `'...'`/`"..."` string literals by default; PostgreSQL, SQLite and H2 do not.
  The guard previously used one, doubling-only rule for every database. For MySQL/ClickHouse connections,
  a crafted value (ending in an escaped quote, more text, then a closing quote) could make the guard
  think a `;` was safely inside a string literal when the database would treat it as a live, second
  statement - confirmed against real MySQL and ClickHouse servers. No path to unauthorized data access or
  modification was found on the current codebase (this project's runners never call `cursor.nextset()`,
  so on MySQL the smuggled statement was queued but never pulled, and MySQL's own read-only-transaction
  mode - already set on every read-only connection - independently rejects a smuggled write; ClickHouse's
  server independently refuses multi-statement queries outright) - but it was a real gap in an explicitly
  documented guarantee and is now fixed with a dialect-aware guard, covered by a fuzz/property test suite
  (`tests/test_sql_guard_fuzz.py`, using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/)) that pins the
  exact confirmed payload and its outcome on each database. `--` comments now also require a following
  whitespace character or end of input, matching real SQL comment syntax, and backtick-identifier doubling
  (`` `` ``) is now recognised - both changes only make the guard *more* likely to reject ambiguous input,
  never less.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Docker images are published to GitHub Container Registry on every release (`ghcr.io/anantharajuc/sql2api`, tags
  `X.Y.Z` and `latest`, plus `-h2` variants with Java and the H2 driver), for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. The
  workflow tests each image before publishing and can be run by hand as a dry run.
- `docker compose up --build` starts a self-contained demo: SQL2API in front of a seeded PostgreSQL database, with
  example saved queries, an API key and a rate limit. CI runs it on every change.
- The image has a `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health`, OCI labels, and access logging.
- Parameter rules for saved queries: besides a type, `query_parameters` can declare `default`, `required`, `enum`,
  `min`/`max`, `min_length`/`max_length`, `pattern` and `description`. Violations are rejected with a 400 that lists
  every problem in an `errors` map; optional parameters without a value are bound as NULL.
- Every saved query is documented as its own endpoint in `/openapi.json` and `/docs`, with its parameters, rules and
  default connection (never its SQL). With an API key set, this section is only shown to authenticated readers, and
  the docs page has a box for the key.
- The Release workflow now refuses to publish when the tag does not match `sql2api.__version__`, is not on `main`,
  or has no dated changelog section.
- CORS support for browser clients (`SQL2API_CORS_ORIGINS`, off by default): allowed origins are echoed back,
  preflight requests are answered without an API key, and the pagination and rate-limit headers are exposed to the
  page. Starting with `*` and no API key logs a warning.
- Rate limiting (`SQL2API_RATE_LIMIT`, e.g. `60/minute`, off by default): a per-client token bucket answering `429` with
  `Retry-After`, plus `X-RateLimit-Limit`/`X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers. It runs before the API key check so key
  guessing is throttled; `/health` and preflights are exempt. A malformed value stops startup.
- `SQL2API_TRUST_PROXY` (number of reverse proxies) makes the app use the client address and scheme from
  `X-Forwarded-*` headers; without it those headers are ignored so they cannot be forged.

### Changed
- Saving a query validates its `query_parameters` and rejects declarations that the SQL does not use.
- Requests rejected by parameter validation are not recorded in `execution_history`.

### Fixed
- The Docker image ran gunicorn with its default 30 second worker timeout, the same as the default query time limit,
  so a query hitting its limit raced gunicorn killing the worker. The timeout is now 120 seconds.
- The OpenAPI document was not valid OpenAPI 3.0 (`exclusiveMinimum: 0` and empty `required` lists), which strict
  tools and client generators reject. It is now validated in the test suite.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Connection pooling for MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and H2: connections are reused between requests instead of
  opened per request (`SQL2API_POOL_SIZE`, default 5 idle connections per distinct setting, `0` disables;
  `SQL2API_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT`, default 300 s). Against a local server, per-request time for a trivial query dropped
  from about 14 ms to 0.5 ms on MySQL and H2; ClickHouse barely changed (about 1.2 ms to 1.0 ms).
  Connections are reset between users, health-checked after idling, discarded after errors, and closed at once when
  a connection is changed or deleted through the API.
- Query time limit: statements are cancelled on the database after `SQL2API_QUERY_TIMEOUT` seconds (default 30,
  `0` disables) and the request fails with HTTP 504. A request can lower the limit with `?timeout=` (or a `timeout`
  field in the body) but never raise it. Enforced natively on MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, SQLite and H2.

### Changed
- Queries that run longer than 30 seconds are now cancelled by default. Set `SQL2API_QUERY_TIMEOUT=0` to restore the
  previous unlimited behaviour.

### Fixed
- The process could hang on exit after H2 had served concurrent requests: JPype waited forever for worker threads
  that jaydebeapi had attached to the JVM as non-daemon threads. Threads that use H2 are now attached as daemons.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-21

First public release, restructured from the original single-file application.

### Added
- Installable `sql2api` package with a `sql2api serve` / `sql2api init` command line and `python -m sql2api`.
- Bound query parameters (`:name`) for every database, so values never become part of the SQL text.
- Saved queries served as endpoints: `GET|POST /q/<name>` with typed parameters and an optional default connection.
- `DELETE /saved_sql/<name>` (whole query or one `?version=`) and `DELETE /connections/<name>`.
- Execution history recorded per saved-query version (last 50 runs, with status, row count and duration).
- `X-Page`, `X-Page-Size` and `X-Has-More` response headers; `ndjson` output format.
- `${ENV_VAR}` references in connection settings so secrets can stay out of `db_connections.json`.
- OpenAPI description at `/openapi.json`, Swagger UI at `/docs` (`/` redirects there), and a `/health` endpoint.
- Read-only-by-default execution (`SQL2API_ALLOW_WRITES`), optional API key (`SQL2API_API_KEY`),
  page size limit (`SQL2API_MAX_PAGE_SIZE`) and configurable data folder (`SQL2API_HOME`).
- Dockerfile, GitHub Actions CI (unit tests plus integration tests against PostgreSQL, MySQL, ClickHouse and H2),
  Dependabot, and runnable examples.

### Changed
- Saved-query and connection files are read from `SQL2API_HOME` (default: the current directory) instead of the
  folder next to the source file; file access is confined to `saved_sql/`.
- Passwords are masked by `GET /connections`.
- Unknown `format` values now return 400; `page_size` is capped; errors use proper HTTP status codes.
- The development server no longer runs in debug mode by default.

### Fixed
- Arbitrary file read through `/view_file_content` and path traversal through saved-query filenames.
- Pagination now works on every database; trailing `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` handling is case-insensitive.
- Database connections are always closed; ClickHouse queries no longer run twice.
- JSON column order is preserved; Decimal, date and driver-specific number types serialise correctly.
- Concurrent saves can no longer lose a version.
