# SQL2API

This project is a Flask-based application designed for executing SQL queries against multiple database types and retrieving the results in various formats.

|---------------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| Database      | JSON | XML | YAML| CSV |  TSV | XLSX |
|---------------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|
| MySQL         | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   |
| Postgres      | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   |
| ClickHouse    | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ   |

**Executing SQL Queries:** Users can execute SQL queries by sending POST requests to the '/execute_sql' endpoint of the application. They need to provide the SQL query and the connection name as part of the request body.

**Query Parameterization:** The application supports query parameterization by allowing users to specify placeholders in their SQL queries. Placeholder values can be provided as part of the request body when executing the query.

**Saving and Managing Queries:** Users can save SQL queries along with metadata such as author, description, and tags by sending PATCH requests to the '/save_sql_to_file' endpoint. They can also manage saved queries, including editing and deleting them.

**Listing Saved Queries:** Users can list the saved queries stored in the application by sending GET requests to the '/list_files' endpoint. The endpoint returns a list of filenames along with versioning information and metadata for each saved query.

**Connection Management:** Users can manage database connections by sending PATCH requests to the '/connections' endpoint. They can add, edit, or delete connection details, including host, port, username, password, and database name.
