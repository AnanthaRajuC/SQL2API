**QueryAPIGate** is a self-hosted, single Flask service that runs SQL against your databases and returns the results as
JSON, NDJSON, XML, YAML, CSV, TSV or Excel. Save a query once and it becomes a versioned endpoint with typed,
injection-safe parameters and run history - without writing a controller, a repository layer, pagination, auth or
serialization boilerplate for it.

Write SQL. Configure the query. Apply access controls. Get an API.

~~~bash
$ curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/example_film_search?text=Harbor&page_size=2'
[{"film_id":48,"title":"Broken Harbor","category":"Action","rating":"PG-13"},{"film_id":44,"title":"Electric Harbor","category":"Documentary","rating":"G"}]

## Why QueryAPIGate?

Organizations often have valuable SQL sitting inside reports, BI dashboards, ETL pipelines, ad-hoc analysis and
application code, with no path to a REST endpoint except writing a backend service around it.

```text
              SQL Query
                  |
                  v
          +------------------+
          |   QueryAPIGate   |
          |                  |
          | Parameters       |
          | SQL Guard        |
          | Permissions      |
          | Rate Limiting    |
          | Caching          |
          | Connection Pool  |
          | Streaming        |
          | Observability    |
          +--------+---------+
                   |
                   v
               REST API
                   |
          +--------+--------+
          v        v        v
        JSON      CSV      XLSX
```

If you already know SQL, you can produce a governed API without building an API application around it.

## Key features

### Multi-database support

Native drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, SQLite, H2 and DuckDB, plus generic JDBC for anything else with a
driver jar - Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake and more. The same guard, pooling, parameter binding and output
formats apply regardless of which database is behind a given connection.

| Database   | JSON | NDJSON | XML | YAML | CSV | TSV | XLSX |
|------------|:----:|:------:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| MySQL      | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |
| PostgreSQL | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |
| ClickHouse | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |
| SQLite     | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |
| H2         | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |
| DuckDB     | ✅   | ✅     | ✅  | ✅   | ✅  | ✅  | ✅   |

### Security and access control

QueryAPIGate is built to expose specific query results, not database credentials:

- API key authentication, with hashed key storage (SHA-256, never the raw secret) in `api_keys.json`.
- Database connection passwords encrypted at rest (`QUERYAPIGATE_SECRET_KEY`), decrypted only in memory at the
  moment a connection is opened; a literal password on disk is never returned to a client either way.
- Scoped API keys: restrict a key to a set of connections, and/or to a specific allow-list of saved queries,
  independent of any connection grant - individual queries in that list can also be curated for write access,
  without granting it anywhere else reachable through the key.
- Example APIs: `queryapigate examples load` installs four worked scenarios - a reporting API, dashboard data,
  a streaming export and a partner integration - as collections, queries and roles you can run and remove again,
  touching nothing of yours.
- Collections: file saved queries into named groups and grant a key a whole group - read-only, live, and every
  move that changes who can reach a query is audited with the keys that gained or lost access. Rename a
  collection without any key losing reach part-way; export one as a portable bundle and import it elsewhere.
- Named permission roles: a reusable template (connections, write access, queries, collections, rate limit, allowed IPs)
  copied onto a key once at creation, so a shared grant set for many keys lives in one place - editing or
  deleting a role afterward never affects a key already created from it.
- Read-only by default; write access (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/DDL) is off unless explicitly enabled server-wide or
  granted per key, and can be narrowed further to specific write operations a key may perform.
- API key expiry (TTL) and revocation.
- Per-key rate limiting, on top of the server-wide, IP-based limit.
- IP allowlisting per key: pin a key to specific addresses or CIDR ranges.
- A row ceiling for streaming exports (`QUERYAPIGATE_STREAM_MAX_ROWS`), unbounded by default.
- A SQL guard that only allows single `SELECT`/`WITH`/`SHOW`/`DESCRIBE`/`EXPLAIN` statements through by default,
  with bound `:name` parameters rather than string-concatenated SQL.

```text
API Consumer
     |
     | API Key
     v
  QueryAPIGate
     |
     +-- Authentication
     +-- Authorization (connections + saved queries)
     +-- SQL guard
     +-- Rate limiting
     +-- Execution
     |
     v
  Database
```

This lets an organization hand an external client a key that can only ever reach one named query - never
arbitrary SQL and never a whole connection - while internal callers keep broader, connection-level access.

### Saved, versioned queries

A saved query bundles SQL, name, description, parameters, author, version, permissions and (optionally) cache
configuration into one addressable resource: `GET /q/<name>`. Saving again under the same name creates a new
version rather than overwriting the old one, so a change to the SQL doesn't silently change what's already live;
`?version=1` still runs the prior one, and each run is recorded in the query's execution history.

### Bound query parameters

```sql
SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id = :id
```

```http
GET /q/film_by_id?id=7
```

Values are sent to the database separately from the SQL text, so they cannot be injected into it. Parameters can
declare a type, default, required/optional, enum, numeric range, length and pattern - invalid input is rejected
with a field-by-field `400` before it reaches the database.

### Multiple response formats

JSON, NDJSON, XML, YAML, CSV, TSV and XLSX are all available per request (`?format=`), so the same saved query
serves both application clients and reporting/export use cases.

### Pagination and streaming

`?page=2&page_size=50` pages results with `X-Has-More` telling the caller whether more exist. For full exports,
`?stream=true&format=csv` (or `tsv`/`ndjson`) streams the entire result straight from the database cursor rather
than buffering it - verified end-to-end with 1,000,000-row results and flat server memory throughout (MySQL,
PostgreSQL and ClickHouse); see [Streaming exports](documentation/API.md#streaming-exports) for the measured
numbers. `queryapigate export <query> --out '/exports/{name}_{date}.csv'` wraps the same streaming path as a CLI
command for cron/systemd/Kubernetes CronJob to call directly - no server needs to be running; see
[Scheduled exports to a file](documentation/INSTALLATION_AND_SETUP.md#scheduled-exports-to-a-file).

### Query caching

Saved queries can opt into HTTP-level caching: `cache_ttl`, `Cache-Control`, `ETag`, conditional requests and
`304 Not Modified`, plus an `X-Cache: HIT`/`MISS` header. Never applied to a query that writes.

### Rate limiting

A server-wide, IP-keyed limit (`QUERYAPIGATE_RATE_LIMIT`) and an independent, optional per-key limit can both be in
effect at once - a request has to pass both. This lets different API consumers get different budgets:

```text
Internal dashboard  -> generous server-wide limit, no per-key limit
Partner key          -> 200/hour of its own
Trial key             -> 20/hour of its own
```

### Observability

Structured JSON logs (`QUERYAPIGATE_JSON_LOGS`) tagged with a request ID, per-query execution timing, slow-query
warnings (`QUERYAPIGATE_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD`), and Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` covering request/query counts and
latencies, connection-pool occupancy and rate-limit rejections.

### OpenAPI

`/openapi.json` is a complete, valid OpenAPI 3.0 document (checked in CI against the official validator) with
every saved query listed as its own typed endpoint; `/docs` serves it through Swagger UI. A key's endpoint list is
filtered to what that key can actually reach, so a query-scoped external key sees only its approved queries.

### Administration UI

A built-in UI at `/ui` covers the whole workflow: connection management, a SQL editor with syntax highlighting
and schema browsing (click a table/column to insert it), query execution and preview, EXPLAIN, saved-query and
version management, API key management, an audit log of administrative changes, per-query execution history,
response inspection with a collapsible JSON tree for non-tabular results, a quick bar chart of any numeric
result, and one-click "copy as curl" / "copy as TSV" for any result.

The UI has a collapsible sidebar (Data, Access, Observability; `Ctrl`+`B` toggles it) and a read-only **Settings**
screen that shows every environment variable, its effective value and whether it was set or is the default (secrets are
reported as configured or not, never shown), with a "Copy as .env" button. Theme, table density and the default
result format are per-browser preferences.

### Testing and quality

Unit tests, integration tests against real MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and H2 servers (run in CI against
service containers), DuckDB integration tests that run unconditionally since it's embedded, SQL-guard fuzz
testing with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/), static type checking with mypy, linting with ruff,
and CI on every push. See [Development](#development) below.

## Best use cases

**Internal data APIs.** Expose internal data to web apps, mobile apps, internal tools and other engineering teams
without building a service per query:

```http
GET /q/film_by_id?id=7
GET /q/example_top_films?top_n=5&category=Comedy
```

**Reporting APIs.** Turn an existing analytical SQL report into a reusable endpoint that dashboards or scheduled
jobs can call directly, in JSON or as a CSV/XLSX export.

**Partner and external-client integrations.** Give a partner an API key scoped to a curated list of saved
queries, with its own rate limit and expiry, instead of database credentials:

```text
Partner --API Key--> QueryAPIGate --queries grant--> Database
```

**Data engineering to application engineering.** Data teams write and version the SQL; application teams consume
it as a normal REST endpoint, without either side depending on the other's deploy cycle.

**Data export.** Stream large results as CSV, TSV, XLSX, JSON or NDJSON without loading the whole result into
memory first.

**Rapid prototyping.** Get a working, parameterized API around an existing query for a proof of concept or
internal tool without standing up a backend application for it.

## How QueryAPIGate differs

| Approach          | Primary model                        |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **QueryAPIGate**  | **SQL query -> governed REST API**   |
| PostgREST         | PostgreSQL schema -> REST API        |
| Hasura            | Database -> GraphQL/API platform     |
| DreamFactory      | Data source -> generated APIs        |
| SQLPad            | SQL -> interactive query environment |

QueryAPIGate's primary abstraction is the SQL query as an API resource, not the schema as a whole - so it fits well
when an API should expose one specific, curated query rather than automatically surface an entire database.

---

## Philosophy

Your database already contains the data logic. The goal isn't to replace application backends; it's to remove
repetitive boilerplate when the actual requirement is "expose this query safely as an API" - existing SQL, plus
governance, is the API.

---

## Install

~~~bash
pip install "queryapigate[postgres]"         # pick the drivers you need: mysql, postgres, clickhouse, h2, duckdb
# or everything:                        pip install "queryapigate[all]"
~~~

SQLite needs no extra driver. H2 and generic JDBC connections (`queryapigate[h2]`) also need a Java runtime; H2's own
driver jar is bundled, a JDBC connection to another vendor brings its own. DuckDB (`queryapigate[duckdb]`) needs no
external runtime either - it's a native Python extension, same as SQLite. `queryapigate[encryption]` adds
[encryption at rest](documentation/API.md#encryption-at-rest-for-connection-passwords) for connection passwords -
only needed if you set `QUERYAPIGATE_SECRET_KEY`.
From a clone: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`. Or use Docker - see [below](#docker).

## Quick start

Fastest: `queryapigate examples load && queryapigate serve` installs four worked [example APIs](documentation/EXAMPLES.md)
(reporting, dashboard, export, partner) you can try, and `queryapigate examples unload` removes them again.

~~~bash
queryapigate examples load
queryapigate serve                            # http://127.0.0.1:5000
~~~

The examples come with a small generated `examples` database (films, customers and rentals), so you can also run ad-hoc SQL
straight away:

~~~bash
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/execute_sql?page_size=3' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"sql": "SELECT film_id, title, rating FROM film WHERE film_id > :min", "params": {"min": 10}, "connection_name": "examples"}'
~~~

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs> for the interactive API reference, or <http://127.0.0.1:5000/ui> for a small
admin UI to manage connections and saved queries and run ad-hoc SQL without leaving the browser.

For your own databases, run `queryapigate init` in an empty folder: it creates `db_connections.json` (inactive templates for
every supported database) and `saved_sql/`. Edit the file, set `"active": true`, and start the server there.

## Saving a query as an endpoint

This uses the `examples` connection that `queryapigate examples load` sets up:

~~~bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:5000/save_sql_to_file -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "filename": "film_by_id",
  "sql_query": "SELECT * FROM film WHERE film_id = :id",
  "query_parameters": {"id": {"type": "int", "min": 1, "max": 60, "description": "Film id"}},
  "connection_name": "examples",
  "author": "me", "description": "Look up a film"
}'

curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/film_by_id?id=7&format=yaml'
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/film_by_id?id=0'

Rules: `type` (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`), `default`, `required`, `enum`, `min`/`max`, `min_length`/`max_length`,
`pattern` and `description` - see [the API reference](documentation/API.md#parameter-rules).

Saving again under the same name adds version 2; `DELETE /saved_sql/film_by_id?version=1` removes one version.

Add `"cache_ttl": 60` to cache a response for that many seconds (`X-Cache: HIT`/`MISS`, `ETag`, `Cache-Control`) -
opt-in, and never used for a query that writes. See
[Response caching](documentation/API.md#response-caching).

## Configuration

Everything is configured through environment variables (all optional):

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `QUERYAPIGATE_HOME` | current directory | Folder holding `db_connections.json` and `saved_sql/`. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_ALLOW_WRITES` | off | Allow `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/DDL. Otherwise only single read-only statements are accepted. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY` | unset | A full-access admin key. When set (or once a scoped key exists via `/api_keys`), every request except `/health`, `/docs`, `/ui`, `/openapi.json` and `/metrics` needs a matching `X-API-Key` header. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_MAX_PAGE_SIZE` | `1000` | Upper limit for `page_size`. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_STREAM_MAX_ROWS` | unset | Row cap for a `?stream=true` export. Off (unbounded) by default; a malformed value stops startup. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_CORS_ORIGINS` | unset | Websites allowed to call the API from a browser: comma-separated origins such as `https://app.example.com`, or `*`. Off by default. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_RATE_LIMIT` | unset | Requests allowed per client address, e.g. `60/minute` (also `second`, `hour`, `day`). Off by default; a malformed value stops startup. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_TRUST_PROXY` | `0` | Number of reverse proxies in front of the app whose `X-Forwarded-*` headers are trusted. Set it (usually `1`) behind nginx, a load balancer or a platform router, or every client looks like the proxy. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_POOL_SIZE` | `5` | Idle connections kept per distinct connection setting. `0` turns pooling off. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Seconds an idle pooled connection is kept before it is closed. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_QUERY_TIMEOUT` | `30` | Seconds a query may run before it is cancelled (HTTP 504). `0` disables the limit. A request can lower it with `?timeout=`, never raise it. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_HOST` / `QUERYAPIGATE_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `5000` | Bind address for `queryapigate serve`. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_DEBUG` | off | Flask debug mode. Never enable on a reachable host. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_H2_JAR` | bundled | Path to a different H2 JDBC jar. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_SECRET_KEY` | unset | A Fernet key encrypting connection passwords at rest. Off by default (stored as given); needs `queryapigate[encryption]`. A malformed value stops startup. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_JSON_LOGS` | off | Emit one JSON object per log line, tagged with the request ID, instead of plain text. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_SLOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD` | `1` | Seconds a query may take before it is logged as a warning. `0` disables it. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_AUDIT_LOG_LIMIT` | `500` | Administrative-change entries kept in `audit_log.json`; older ones roll off. Always a positive count; a malformed value stops startup. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_LOAD_EXAMPLES` | unset | `yes` loads the [example APIs](documentation/EXAMPLES.md) (reporting, dashboard, export, partner) at startup - idempotent; a malformed value stops startup. Never removes anything: use `queryapigate examples unload`. |
| `QUERYAPIGATE_AUDIT_LOG_EXPORT_FILE` | unset | Path to also append every audit entry to, one JSON object per line, never capped - for retention beyond the rolling window above. |

## Security and production considerations

QueryAPIGate runs whatever SQL it is given against your databases, so it ships locked down and expects you to finish the job:

- Set `QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY` and serve over TLS (put it behind a reverse proxy). It's a full-access admin key;
  for anyone who only needs to run queries against specific connections, create a scoped key instead
  (`POST /api_keys`, admin only) - see [documentation/API.md](documentation/API.md#authentication-and-permissions).
  For an external client that should only reach a curated handful of saved queries and nothing else, scope
  the key to those query names specifically (`queries`) instead of a whole connection - see
  [Per-saved-query access](documentation/API.md#per-saved-query-access-external-clients).
- Connect with a database account that only has the privileges the API needs - the read-only guard is
  defence in depth, not a replacement for grants. (H2's driver cannot enforce read-only, so H2 relies on the guard.)
- Use bound `:name` parameters. The older `{name}` placeholders paste text into the SQL and are therefore restricted
  to numbers and plain text.
- Saved-query files are only read from `saved_sql/`; passwords are never returned by the API.
- Set `QUERYAPIGATE_SECRET_KEY` to encrypt connection passwords at rest instead of relying solely on the `${VAR}`
  convention - keep the key itself outside `db_connections.json` and out of version control, the same as any
  other credential; there is no way to recover an encrypted password without it.
- Set query timeouts and result-size expectations deliberately (`QUERYAPIGATE_QUERY_TIMEOUT`, `QUERYAPIGATE_MAX_PAGE_SIZE`),
  enable rate limiting, and route logs and `/metrics` into your existing monitoring.
- Plan for backup and recovery of `db_connections.json`, `saved_sql/` and `api_keys.json` (`QUERYAPIGATE_HOME`), and
  put QueryAPIGate behind your normal reverse-proxy/TLS-termination setup rather than exposing it directly.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to report a vulnerability.

### Calling the API from a browser

Browsers refuse cross-origin JSON calls unless the server allows them. List the sites that may call the API:

~~~bash
QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY=change-me QUERYAPIGATE_CORS_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com queryapigate serve
~~~

Preflight checks are answered automatically, and the pagination headers (`X-Has-More` etc.) are exposed to the page's
JavaScript. CORS only tells the *browser* which sites may call; it is not authentication, so keep the API key. Avoid
`*` without a key: any website a visitor opens could then reach your databases through their browser (the server logs
a warning if you start that way).

### Rate limiting

`QUERYAPIGATE_RATE_LIMIT=60/minute` gives each client address a bucket of 60 requests that refills steadily, so short bursts
work but the sustained rate is capped. Over the limit, requests get `429` with a `Retry-After` header, and every
response carries `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining`. The limit is applied before the API key check, so
guessing keys is throttled too; `/health` and CORS preflights are never counted. State is per process: with several
workers, the effective limit is multiplied by the number of workers.

An API key can also carry its own `rate_limit` (same grammar), checked in addition to the server-wide limit, never
instead of it - a request has to pass both. See [Per-key rate limiting](documentation/API.md#per-key-rate-limiting).

## Docker

Every release is published to GitHub Container Registry for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

~~~bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -v queryapigate-data:/data -e QUERYAPIGATE_API_KEY=change-me ghcr.io/anantharajuc/queryapigate:latest
~~~

| Tag | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| `X.Y.Z`, `latest` | QueryAPIGate with the MySQL, PostgreSQL and ClickHouse drivers (SQLite is built in) |
| `X.Y.Z-h2`, `latest-h2` | The same plus Java and the H2 driver - also the variant to use for a generic `jdbc` connection (mount your vendor's jar) |

The container keeps `db_connections.json` and `saved_sql/` in `/data` (create a starter with
`docker run --rm -v queryapigate-data:/data ghcr.io/anantharajuc/queryapigate queryapigate init`). The named volume above works
out of the box. To use a folder on the host instead (`-v "$PWD/data:/data"`), create it yourself first (`mkdir data`) and make sure
it is writable by uid 1000, the container's user - a folder that Docker creates for you is owned by root, which the container
cannot write to (or run with `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"`). It runs as a non-root user under
gunicorn with one worker (the files are protected by an in-process lock) and a health check on `/health`. Behind a
reverse proxy or load balancer, set `QUERYAPIGATE_TRUST_PROXY=1`. To build it yourself:
`docker build -t queryapigate .` (add `--build-arg WITH_H2=true` for H2).

### Try it with one command

[`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/AnanthaRajuC/QueryAPIGate/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) starts QueryAPIGate in front
of a PostgreSQL database seeded with sample films:

~~~bash
docker compose up --build
curl -H 'X-API-Key: demo-key' 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/q/films_by_rating?rating=PG&max_length=90'
~~~

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs>, paste `demo-key` into the box at the top, and both saved queries appear as endpoints.
The demo listens on localhost only, mounts its configuration read-only, and reads the database password from an
environment variable (`${DEMO_DB_PASSWORD}` in
[`demo/data/db_connections.json`](https://github.com/AnanthaRajuC/QueryAPIGate/blob/main/demo/data/db_connections.json)).
Clean up with `docker compose down -v`.

## API overview

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/execute_sql` | POST | Run ad-hoc SQL (`sql`, `connection_name`, optional `params`). |
| `/q/<name>` | GET, POST | Run a saved query; query-string or body values become parameters. |
| `/save_sql_to_file` | PATCH | Save a query (creates the next version). |
| `/list_files` | GET | List saved queries and their versions (`sort_by`, `sort_order`). |
| `/saved_sql/<name>` | DELETE | Delete a saved query or one `?version=`. |
| `/view_file_content` | GET | Raw content of a saved query file. |
| `/execute_sql_from_file`, `/execute_sql_with_parameters_from_file` | POST | Run a saved query by `filepath` (same as `/q/<name>`). |
| `/connections` | GET, PATCH | List (passwords masked) / add / update connections. |
| `/connections/<name>` | DELETE | Remove a connection. |
| `/connections/<name>/schema` | GET | List its tables/views and their columns. |
| `/api_keys` | GET, POST | List / create scoped API keys (admin only). |
| `/api_keys/<name>` | PATCH, DELETE | Update / revoke a scoped API key (admin only). |
| `/audit_log` | GET | Durable record of administrative changes - keys, connections, saved queries (admin only). |
| `/settings` | GET | The server's own configuration - each setting's effective value and whether it comes from the environment or the default; read-only, secrets never returned (admin only). |
| `/health`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json` | GET | Liveness, Swagger UI, OpenAPI spec. |
| `/metrics` | GET | Prometheus text-format metrics: request/query counts and latencies, pool occupancy, rate-limit rejections. |
| `/ui` | GET | A small admin UI: manage connections and saved queries, run ad-hoc SQL. |

Full details are in [documentation/API.md](documentation/API.md).

## Client SDKs

`/openapi.json` is a complete, valid OpenAPI 3.0 document (checked in CI against the official validator), so a typed
client for Java, TypeScript, Go, or [any of the ~50 languages `openapi-generator` supports](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators)
costs nothing in application code - generate it from the running server's own spec:

~~~bash
npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/openapi.json -g java -o clients/java
# or: -g typescript-fetch, -g go, -g python, ...
~~~

This is deliberately not something QueryAPIGate ships pre-generated: the spec already includes every saved query
as its own typed `/q/<name>` endpoint (see [Quick start](#quick-start) above), so a client generated against
*your* server reflects *your* saved queries, not a generic snapshot.

## Development

~~~bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .
mypy queryapigate
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
~~~

The integration tests in `tests/test_integration.py` run against real MySQL, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and H2 servers when
the matching `QUERYAPIGATE_IT_*` variables are set, and are skipped otherwise; CI runs them against service containers.
DuckDB's integration tests need no such variable - being embedded, they run unconditionally whenever the `duckdb`
package is installed.
`tests/test_sql_guard_fuzz.py` fuzzes the SQL guard and parameter binder with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/).

[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) for what's planned, in priority order.

## Documentation

Full documentation covers installation, configuration, database connections (including JDBC and DuckDB),
saved queries and parameters, authentication and authorization, API keys, rate limiting, caching, streaming,
OpenAPI, metrics, the admin UI, security and deployment. Start at the
[documentation site](https://AnanthaRajuC.github.io/QueryAPIGate/) or the `documentation/` directory in this repo.

## Roadmap

See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) for the full, prioritized list with rationale. Currently open: table-level
query allow-listing (write operation-type granularity and a streaming row ceiling already shipped), and not
recommended without a specific hard requirement since it needs real SQL parsing. Everything else on the list
is shipped, including reusable permission roles/templates on top of per-key ACLs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome - database drivers, security, performance, UI, documentation, testing and
observability are all useful areas. Please review [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting changes.

## Third-party components

The wheel bundles the [H2 Database](https://h2database.com) JDBC driver (MPL 2.0 / EPL 1.0). The example data is generated
locally by `queryapigate examples load`; no third-party datasets are included.
